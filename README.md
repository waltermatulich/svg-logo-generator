SVG Logo Generator!

In this application you will find a command line terminal to where if you implement the code node index.js you are then prompted with a series of questions asking for a shape and then a color. You will then be given a line of code in an SVG file. You can open the file is SVG preview to see that what you have done works correctly and efficiently. That is all I have. Below will be a recording of my explenation as to how to use the website and some speaking to the code that I have embedded in my js files. Thank you!
