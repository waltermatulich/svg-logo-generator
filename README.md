The Custom Logo Generator is a command-line application tailored for swift and straightforward logo design. It guides users through a seamless series of prompts: from entering a concise text of up to three characters, choosing text and shape colors (with the flexibility of using color keywords or hexadecimal values), to selecting a shape from options such as a circle, triangle, or square. This process culminates in the creation of a `logo.svg` file, perfectly blending user specifications into a 300x200 pixel image that's instantly ready for review upon opening in any standard browser.
